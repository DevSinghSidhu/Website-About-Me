    style="color: red;">Hi! My name is <i>Dev</i>, and I am 12 years old. I go to school at the <b>Bombay
        International School</b>. <br> I have a younger sister, and live in <u>Mumbai</u>.<br>
        I created this website to let you know a bit about me. <br>
        I can be a bit annoying to some people who know me, and I have the ability to make poeple angry really easily.<br>
        I am moderately funny, and enjoy telling jokes to my friends.
